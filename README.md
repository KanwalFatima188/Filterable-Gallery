# Filterable-GalleryðŸŽ¨
A filterable gallery is a type of image or content gallery where users can apply filters to view specific categories or tags. This is especially useful when displaying large sets of images, products, or other content types, and allows users to easily sort or search through the items based on their preferences or interests.
